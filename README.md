--------------------

BC+ evaluates the player's journal and serves web pages with useful
informaton. I.e. one can easily access BC+ from any computer, tablet
or smartphone without ATL-TAB'ing away from E:D.

Currnetly information for long distance tarvel is supported - I'm on
the way to Beagle Point. It displays estimations based on the recent
jump history:

As well as the availability of raw materials on scanned bodies in the
current system:
