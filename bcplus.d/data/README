Many people mighth think why there are so many different files for one
dataset. The reason is, I wanna have simple assisted editing. And to
me it is simple to write a RelaxNG schema for the data and then let
GNU emacs assist me with nxml-complete and hippie-expand.

So, for those who might be not so familiar wit the toolchain, here is
what I do:

1. Write a simple XML file containing a little of the data I need.
2. Use trang to generate a RelaxNG Compact Syntax schema skeleton.
3. Refine the skeleton to describe the data I intend to edit.
4. Go back to the XML file and set the new schema for the XML file.
5. Enjoy content assisted XML editing until I'm done or find an error
   or missing element in the schema.
6. If not done: goto 3.
7. Create an XSLT to generate the data I really wanna process in my
   software.
8. Extend the Makefile so that I only have to type 'make' in my
   terminal when I edited one of the XML files.

Simple, open, and cheapâ€¦
