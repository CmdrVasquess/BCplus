<ul>
  <li>
If you see this keyboard icon <img src="s/img/Kbd.png" alt="keboad"
style="height: 1em;">, text before the icon is highlighted when your
mouse hovers over it. With a single click the highlighted text is send
as keyboard input on the computer running BC+. This is particularly
useful to send system names to the input box of the galaxy map.

  <li>
BC+ is currently not connected to any other E:D player platforms like
EDDN etc. This is planned for the future. However interaction with
those community sites and—even more—with the companion API involves
handling of sensitive user credentials. This needs some security build
into BC+: Encrypted storage of those credentials as well as using
HTTPS for the Web GUI. Integration will not be implemented before
security is in place.
